This is a cool repo to keep up track of my scripts and aliases between different computers.

<h1>Installation</h1>

Clone the repo wherever you want, and add the command
"source [whereveryouwant]/sourcer"
inside your .bash_profile

Everything is ordered (first colors, then functions, then stuff that uses functions)

Do not hesitates to give me hints if you see some heretic code!
