This is a cool repo to keep up track of my scripts and aliases between different computers.

Everything works for bash, I did not test any other shell.
I like to do it with basics tools, as I think the most of them are enough to handle whatever you want to do.

<h1>Installation</h1>

Clone the repo wherever you want, and add the command

```shell
source [whereveryouwant]/sourcer
```

inside your .bash_profile


Everything is ordered (first colors, then functions, then stuff that uses functions)

Do not hesitates to give me hints if you see some heretic code!
